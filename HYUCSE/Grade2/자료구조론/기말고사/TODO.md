# To do

## 1. Heap
 - heap : max, min heap
 - selection tree : winner, loser tree

## 2. Tree
 - avl tree : rotation, insert
 - red-black tree : recoloring, reconstructing, insertion, deletion
 - B-tree : insertion, deletion (split, merge)
 - B+ tree : insertion

## 3. Hashing
 - hash : hash table, hash function, collision, overflow
 - collision & handling method 
     - linear probing, quadratic probing, random probing 
     - array linear list, chain
 - extensible hashing : insertion

## 4. Sorting
 - merge sort
 - quick sort
 - heap sort
 - radix sort

## 5. Graph
 - eulerian path
 - undirected graph & directed graph
 - complete graph : adjacent, incident
 - subgraph : simple path, cycle
 - connected component
 - strongly connected & strongly connected component
 - in-degree & out-degree
 - graph representation
    - adjacency matrix
    - adjacency list
    - inverse adjacency list
    - sparse matrix
    - adjacency multilist
 - graph operation
    - finding path : dfs, bfs
    - search
    - spanning tree
 - kruskal's algorithm
 - prim's algorithm
 - sollin's algorithm
 - dijkstra's algorithm
